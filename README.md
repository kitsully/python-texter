WORK IN PROGRESS!

This is a work in progress. In the end this script will be able to send short SMS alerts at a given time through email. It currently has the ability to text Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile numbers. The messages must be in a separate text file and the number of characters should not exceed 160. If you use this script you will need to enter in your own email details. 


The script uses argparse. There are two required arguments, a 10 digit phone number and a network. Optional requirement include the relative path to the location of the file with the text message you want to send and the number of time you would like that message to be repeated (mainly added to play a prank on my brother no real practical functionality). 

Current Plans for the Future:

1) Add capability for messages to be entered as a string on the command line.
2) Add capability to specify a time of day for the message to be sent. 



Dedication:
A special thanks to my friend Sarah, who was the inspiration for this script. And who though I never told her was a great help to me in getting through the 2012 FALL Semester of Hell.
